# When-Longest-Is-Shortest
BSc project


This repository was used by my BSc project partner and I to collaborate on our code. The project was only assessed via the report, so this code base is quite messy and a lot of documentation is missing. There was not a lot of time allocated to this project, so the focus was on getting the code working and extracting the results, often at the cost of proper documentation.
